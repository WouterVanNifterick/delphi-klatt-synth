Klatt Speech Synthesizer

This can be used to do text to speech, or generate singing sounds.

It's a commandline tool that takes a Klatt file as an input, and generates a sample as output.

The code is based on the The Klatt Synthesizer which was designed by Dennis H. Klatt in 1980. 
Dectalk, which was Stephen Hawking's voice, was largely based on this.
